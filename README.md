# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive map, that will map earthquake activity from the past seven days, aswell as map out the tectonic plates. 

## Process

The process of making these maps, includes using leaflet and javascript to create a map and multiple layers and overlays. The data that is utilized comes from a GeoJSON file. Tile layers are also included to change the view of the map from street view, satellite view, and a dark view. Circle markers are added to show the location of the earthquake and a radius fuction displays the magnitude in an easy to comprehend way. Through binding a popup to each point, a user need simply click on a marker and the pop up will allow them to read the location and magnitude of the earthquake. With the included overlay, the user can add or remove the circlemarkers from the map.
